## 🧩 Project Introduction / Objective  

The main purpose of this project is to **analyze socio-economic and demographic factors influencing child malnutrition in India** using the **NFHS-5 dataset**.  
By integrating **statistical methods and machine learning**, the study aims to uncover hidden patterns and predict malnutrition outcomes. The insights generated can support **evidence-based policymaking** and **targeted intervention programs** to reduce child malnutrition at both regional and national levels.  

### 🎯 Key Objectives  
- Analyze NFHS-5 data on nutrition and socio-economic indicators.  
- Apply probability and statistical methods to detect significant risk factors.  
- Develop machine learning models to predict child malnutrition outcomes.  
- Evaluate and interpret model results to highlight major determinants.  
- Suggest data-driven recommendations for public health policies.

## 📊 Project Description  

This project leverages the **National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5)** dataset to study **how socio-economic conditions such as education, sanitation, wealth, and healthcare access** contribute to child malnutrition in India.  

### 📚 Dataset Overview  
- **Source:** National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), Government of India  
- **Size:** ~600,000 observations  
- **Variables:** 26+ demographic and socio-economic indicators  
- **Key Features:** Child nutritional status, maternal education, household wealth index, sanitation access, and regional health infrastructure.  


### ⚠️ Challenges Encountered  
- Handling missing or inconsistent survey data.  
- Balancing model interpretability and predictive accuracy.  
- Addressing regional disparities and variable imbalances in NFHS data.
