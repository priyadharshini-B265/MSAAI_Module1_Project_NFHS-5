Our project aims to analyze the socio-economic and demographic determinants of child stunting in India using the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) dataset. The objectives are:

To apply probability and statistical methods (hypothesis testing, regression analysis) to identify significant predictors of child stunting.

To build a logistic regression model and evaluate its predictive accuracy.

To explore regional and household-level variations in stunting outcomes.

To practice version control and collaborative coding using GitHub.
