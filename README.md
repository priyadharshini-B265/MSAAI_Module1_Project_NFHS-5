This project leverages NFHS-5 data to examine how socio-economic factors such as education, sanitation, wealth, and healthcare access influence child malnutrition in India. Using statistical analysis and machine learning models, the study identifies key predictors and provides insights for effective policy interventions.

Objectives

•	Analyze NFHS-5 data on nutrition and socio-economic indicators.

•	Apply probability and statistical methods to detect significant risk factors.

•	Develop ML models to predict child malnutrition outcomes.

•	Evaluate and interpret model results to highlight major determinants.

•	Suggest data-driven recommendations for public health policies.
